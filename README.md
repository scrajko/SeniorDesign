**wifi_testing.grc** <br>
GNURadio Companion File used to interface with the USRP2 device and collect samples into a file for later processing. GNURadio collects WiFi data from the USRP2 device as complex time samples, takes series of 1024-size FFTs of them, then writes their magnitudes to a file.

**WiFiCUPlots.m** <br>
MATLAB file used to process the data sent to the samples file generated by GNURadio, in order to produce a binary-blocking plot with respect to time.
This MATLAB file, when run, expects a set of raw data of samples. Each sample should be a 32-bit floating point number.

The function can be called in MATLAB as
```
WiFiCUPlots('example_samples.dat')
```

**WiFiCUPlots_in_python.py** <br>
An alternative way to process the data sent to the samples file generated by GNURadio. The raw data should be in the same format as above. Writing the program in Python will make it easier to re-write it as a custom GNURadio block in the future.
